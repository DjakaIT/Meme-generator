# Meme-generator

A project made in React, powered with Vite. Fun project to test hook knowledge

This was made as a solution to a project challenge on Scrimba, a platform where you can learn or upgrade your coding skills.

In this project I've honed skills such as using hook useEffect(), API usage in React, async/await, and got to perfect props a bit more.
